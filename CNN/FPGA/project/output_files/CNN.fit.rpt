Note: For more information on problematic transfers, consider running the Fitter again with the Optimize hold timing option (Settings Menu) turned off.
This will disable optimization of problematic paths and expose them for further analysis using the TimeQuest Timing Analyzer.

; Fitter Messages ;
+-----------------+
Info (20030): Parallel compilation is enabled and will use 12 of the 12 processors detected
Info (119004): Automatically selected device EP3C16F484C6 for design CNN
Info (119005): Fitting design with smaller device may be possible, but smaller device must be specified
Info (21076): High junction temperature operating condition is not set. Assuming a default value of '85'.
Info (21076): Low junction temperature operating condition is not set. Assuming a default value of '0'.
Info (171003): Fitter is performing an Auto Fit compilation, which may decrease Fitter effort to reduce compilation time
Info (176444): Device migration not selected. If you intend to use device migration later, you may need to change the pin assignments as they may be incompatible with other devices
    Info (176445): Device EP3C40F484C6 is compatible
    Info (176445): Device EP3C55F484C6 is compatible
    Info (176445): Device EP3C80F484C6 is compatible
Info (169124): Fitter converted 5 user pins into dedicated programming pins

Warning (15714): Some pins have incomplete I/O assignments. Refer to the I/O Assignment Warnings report for details
Info (176045): Design uses memory blocks. Violating setup or hold times of memory block address registers for either read or write operations could cause memory contents to be corrupted. Make sure that all memory block address registers meet the setup and hold time requirements.
